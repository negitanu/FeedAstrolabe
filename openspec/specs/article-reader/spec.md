## Purpose

Provide progressive Japanese article browsing with filter-bound continuation and persistent reading state.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Article browsing
The system SHALL provide a responsive Japanese UI, newest-first article lists, article detail, HTTP(S) original links, and combined feed, folder, unread, starred, text search, workspace and tag filters. The reader SHALL progressively append matching articles as the user scrolls, without numbered pages, previous/next page controls or a user-facing result-count limit. Opening a detail SHALL NOT mutate read state; marking read SHALL require an explicit POST. Public API pagination SHALL remain compatible.

#### Scenario: Search and filter
- **WHEN** a user selects unread articles and searches for a title or content fragment
- **THEN** only matching unread articles are listed, and all subsequent batches retain the same complete filter

#### Scenario: Browse empty list
- **WHEN** no articles match the selected view
- **THEN** a meaningful empty state is displayed without a loading loop or pagination controls

#### Scenario: Read beyond the first batch
- **WHEN** the end of the rendered list approaches the viewport
- **THEN** the next batch is appended once in descending published_at/id order until no matching results remain, with no page navigation

#### Scenario: Stable continuation while data changes
- **WHEN** newer articles arrive or earlier articles are removed between continuation requests
- **THEN** existing matching articles are not skipped because of offset shifts and an article ID is not rendered twice

#### Scenario: Invalid or mismatched continuation
- **WHEN** a continuation is modified, malformed or used with different reader filters
- **THEN** the request fails without returning an unfiltered or broader batch

#### Scenario: Loading failure and keyboard access
- **WHEN** an additional request fails or automatic intersection observation is unavailable
- **THEN** existing articles remain visible and a keyboard-operable control can retry or load the next batch without an automatic retry loop

#### Scenario: Keep the loaded list while reading
- **WHEN** a user opens an appended article, navigates between article details, closes the detail or returns with browser history
- **THEN** the loaded cards, display layout, filters and reading position remain available without resetting to the first batch

#### Scenario: Read and star from an appended article
- **WHEN** a user marks an appended article read/unread or starred/unstarred
- **THEN** the mutation applies to that article and the retained list is reconciled with the active filter without duplicate cards or a pagination transition

#### Scenario: Legacy and no-script access
- **WHEN** an old reader URL contains a page parameter or JavaScript is disabled
- **THEN** its valid filters and requested article remain usable, and all matching articles remain reachable through a full-results fallback without numbered pagination

### Requirement: Persistent reading state
The system SHALL persist individual read/unread and starred/unstarred state and allow marking all articles in the current filter read.

#### Scenario: Persist state
- **WHEN** an article is marked read and starred and the application restarts
- **THEN** both states remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Scoped bulk read
- **WHEN** a filtered view is marked read
- **THEN** only articles matching that view become read

#### Scenario: Preserve incoming reader fixes
- **WHEN** source content changes without a stable article ID, a bulk-read POST includes conflicting query parameters, or a detail is outside the selected filters
- **THEN** mutable body text does not mint another fallback ID, the POST form supplies the scope, and an out-of-filter detail returns 404

#### Scenario: Keyboard reading with progressive loading
- **WHEN** a user invokes reader shortcuts outside an input or interactive control
- **THEN** navigation and read/star actions operate on the current loaded cards, including appended cards, without adding duplicate navigation controls
